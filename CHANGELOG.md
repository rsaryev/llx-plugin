# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The evidence pipeline: `docs:pull` mirrors the official Claude Code docs, `spec:extract` turns
  them into `spec/requirements.json`, and `compat` reports the share each test run proves.
- Official types re-exported from `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, with `HOOK_EVENTS` and
  `HOOK_HANDLER_TYPES` asserted equal to the SDK's unions.
- `readManifest` and `validateManifest` for `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- The ports a host implements (`PluginFiles`, `CommandRunner`, `HttpClient`, `ModelRunner`,
  `McpCaller`, `Locations`, `Environment`, `Clock`, `ScratchFiles`), type-only, and in-memory fakes
  of each for tests.
- A frontmatter parser (`parseFrontmatter`) and the value coercions of skills, commands and
  agents (`readFlag`, `readText`, `readList`, `readTable`, `readEnum`).
- `EFFORT_LEVELS`, asserted equal to the SDK's `EffortLevel`, and the official `EffortLevel`,
  `SlashCommand` and `ResolvedSettingSource` types re-exported.
